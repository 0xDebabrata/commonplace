## Capture, remember and reflect on what matters

Commonplace gives you a place to collect your thoughts while reading and a tool to look back on them in the future.

Gather, organize, store, and display the ideas, quotes, observations, stories—anything at all—that you need or want to refer to in the future.
It's like an ongoing journal where you collect the best of yourself -- something that can be turned to time after time when you're looking for inspiration or just want to enjoy the things you've found.
