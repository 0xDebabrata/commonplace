Till now Commonplace only supported plain text formatting. Now, it has support for markdown for writing excerpts and notes. With markdown support, you have a more powerful tool to express your thoughts while noting down things that resonate with you and would like to look back in the future.

## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.
Commonplace now supports Markdown for writing excerpts and notes. 

The previous version of Commonplace had no support for markdown. This meant that the users couldn't use formatting options like boldface, lists, headings, etc. Now with the new update all the markdown formatting options are available in Commonplace.

## How to use Markdown in Commonplace

Using markdown is extremely easy and intuitive in Commonplace. You can use markdown syntax for writing the excerpt and note for a card and you will be able to see the corresponding preview. Markdown starts working from the get go.
Those who are not familiar with markdown but would like to use to it for their cards can easily view the syntax by clicking on the "Markdown Help" button situated below the excerpt and note input fields.
